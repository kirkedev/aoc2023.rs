Advent of Code 2023
---

### Running solutions

```bash
cargo run --bin day1
cargo run --bin day2
```

Note that the author of Advent of Code has stated that he doesn't want puzzle inputs shared publicly, so they are not
included in this repo.
If you want to run the code, you'll need to supply your own puzzle inputs by creating an inputs folder that includes
each day's input.
So you would store the first day's puzzle input at `/input/day1` and the second day's at `input/day2`

### Run tests

```bash
cargo test
```
